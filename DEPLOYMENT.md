## Deployment Notes

1. **Static HTML Deployment**: The main website consists of 5 optimized static HTML files
2. **Self-contained**: Each page includes all necessary CSS and JavaScript inline
3. **No Dependencies**: Pages work independently without external CSS/JS files
4. **Mobile Responsive**: All pages are optimized for mobile and desktop
5. **SEO Ready**: Proper meta tags and semantic HTML structure

## Navigation Structure
